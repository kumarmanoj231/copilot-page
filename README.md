# TailwindCSS Practice Project

This project is a practice repository designed to brush up on Tailwind CSS skills. Inspired by Microsoft Copilot's recent promotion, I decided to dive back into Tailwind for rapid and responsive design. This project is built with Tailwind CLI, using modern components and utility-first classes to create an efficient, stylish web layout.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- Tailwind CLI
